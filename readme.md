# Olympic Dataset Guided Project

Hello budding Data Scientists, let's try out a guided project which will enable you to get answers to questions using basic python and pandas. We will be using the Olympics data set. You will learn how to handle and clean the data in pandas. You will also learn to answer questions using simple operations. 


## You will learn to apply :

- Python Basics
- Python Programming Constructs
- Data Structures
- Functions
- Object Oriented Programming in Python



## About the IPL Dataset

You will be working on olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry. An [all-time medal table for all Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) from 1896 to 2016, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.
